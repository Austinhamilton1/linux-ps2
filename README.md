# linux-ps2

This repository contains the software necessary for integrating a Playstation
2 Dualshock controller with the linux kernel.

Inside this repository is the linux device driver as well as the firmware
necessary to allow for Arduino-Dualshock communication.

# TODO
* Create schematic for Arduino-Dualshock hardware connection
* Create firmware for communication between Arduino-Dualshock communication
* Create USB protocol for communication of Dualshock inputs to linux host machine
* Create linux device driver to map Dualshock inputs to keystrokes/mouse movement
